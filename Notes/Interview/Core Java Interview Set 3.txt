1. Explain abstract class in Java.
2. What is the need of abstract class?
3. Explain interface in Java8.
4. Why do we need interfaces?
5. Using interface reference we can invoke only those methods which are present in it.
Given:

interface myinterface
{
	void disp();
}
public class MyClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		myinterface m1,m2=null;
		m1.disp();
		m1.fun();
		m1.toString();
		m1.equals(m2);
		m1.hashCode();
	}
}

Which of the above invocations are illegal at compile-time?
6. When to use interface and when to use abstract class? Explain with example.
7. What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java8?
8. What are the default methods in Java8 interfaces?
9. What is the actual use of “default” method in interface?
10. Why do we need static methods in interface?
11. Explain this vs super in case of constructor invocation.
12. What do u mean by immutable class?
13. How to create immutable class in java?
14. Difference bet’n  StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
15. When u try to print any reference variable in java, u get some meaningful output. What do u mean by this?
16. Why can’t we instantiate abstract class?
17. Can abstract class have constructors in Java?
18. Can abstract classes implements interface in Java? Do they require to implement all methods?
19. Can abstract class be final in Java?
20. Can abstract class have static methods in Java?
21. Is it necessary for abstract class to have abstract method?
22. Can abstract class contains main method in Java?
23. What do you mean by “Functional Interface”?
